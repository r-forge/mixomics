Changes in 2.8
================

New features:
-------------
- new arguments ("axis.labelX", "axis.labelY") in the function imgCor, to indicate if the labels of axis have to be shown or not

- splsda & plsda have been improved to be computationally more efficient and allow to check the input data

- new function map & unmap borrowed from the mclust package

- predict has been improved, the objects .plsda and .splsda can now be used and there is a new argument called 'method' ("class.dist", "centroids.dist", "Sr.dist", "KA.dist")

Bug fixes:
----------


Changes in 2.7-1
================

New features:
-------------

- new functions pca, plsda and splsda, as well as extensions of plot3dVar and plot3dIndiv for pca 

- new network.default function which is called by network.rcc and network.spls

- bin.color function added in network.default to color edges w.r.t. the values in the simMat matrix

- nipals has been improved to be computationally more efficient

- missing values are treated as in Tenenhaus in pls, spls and valid functions

- new argument 'ncomp' in rcc function, argument 'ncomp' has been removed from 'summary' and 'rcc'

- new option ("XY-variate") for the argument 'rep.space' in the 'plot3dVar'


Bug fixes:
----------
-'tick marks' values have been corrected for color key in cim

-computation of the simMat matrix for pls and spls - canonical mode, and correction in plotVar, plot3dVar, cim and network

-correction of the default argument 'rep.space = "XY-variate"' in plotIndiv and plot3dIndiv

-correction of the manual



Changes in 2.6-0
================

New features:
-------------
- former R package integrOmics has been renamed mixOmics

- in functions plotIndiv(), plotVar(), cim(), network() the arguments 'dim1', 'dim2', 'ncomp' 
  were replaced by 'comp', a vector of length 2 (by default 'comp = 1:2')

- network() has a new argument 'alpha'
