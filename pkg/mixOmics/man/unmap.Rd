\title{
  Converts a class vector to an indicator matrix
}
\description{
  Converts a class vector into a matrix of indicator variables, borrowed from the mclust package, used as internal function.
}
\usage{
  unmap(classification, groups=NULL, noise=NULL, \dots)
}
\arguments{
  \item{classification}{
    A numeric or character vector. Typically the distinct entries of this
    vector would represent a classification of observations in a data set.
  }
  \item{groups}{
    A numeric or character vector indicating the groups from which
    \code{classification} is drawn. If not supplied, the default
    is to assumed to be the unique entries of classification.
  }
  \item{noise}{
    A single numeric or character value used to indicate the value of
    \code{groups} corresponding to noise.
  }
 \item{\dots }{
     Catches unused arguments in indirect or list calls via \code{do.call}.
  }
}
\value{
  An \emph{n} by \emph{m} matrix of \emph{(0,1)} indicator variables,
  where \emph{n} is the length of \code{classification} and \emph{m} is
  the number of unique values or symbols in  \code{classification}. 
  Columns are labeled by the unique values in \code{classification}, 
  and the \code{[i,j]}th entry is \emph{1} if \code{classification[i]} 
  is the \emph{j}th unique value or symbol in sorted order 
  \code{classification}. 
  If a \code{noise} value of symbol is designated, the corresponding indicator 
  variables are relocated to the last column of the matrix.
