
Changes in 2.9-1
================

New features:
-------------
- New S3 methods plotIndiv and plotVar for PCA.

- New S3 method plot.valid to display the results of the valid function.

- New code for imgCor function for a nicer representation of the correlation matrix.

- In predict.plsda and predict.splsda functions the argument 'method' were replaced by
method = c("max.dist", "class.dist", "centroids.dist", "mahalanobis.dist")

- New arguments for the cim function:
* dendrogram
* ColSideColors, RowSideColors

- Modifying the valid function:
* missing data are allowed
* Q2 criterion has been removed

- Functions pls, plsda, spls and splsda were modified to identify zero- or near-zero variance predictors.

- Functions plotVar.plsda, plotVar.splsda, plot3dVar.plsda, plot3dVar.splsda were modified to represent only the X variables

- New function: 'nearZeroVar' for identification of zero- or near-zero variance predictors 

Changes in 2.8-1
================

New features:
-------------
- new arguments ("axis.labelX", "axis.labelY") in the function imgCor, to indicate if the labels of axis have to be shown or not

- new classes splsda and plsda for predict, print, plotIndiv, plot3dIndiv, plotVar, plot3dVar

- several prediction functions are avaiable to predict the classes of test data with plsda and splsda see predict (argument 'method' ("class.dist", "centroids.dist", "Sr.dist", "max.dist"))

- new functions map & unmap borrowed from the mclust package


Bug fixes:
----------


Changes in 2.7-1
================

New features:
-------------

- new functions pca, plsda and splsda, as well as extensions of plot3dVar and plot3dIndiv for pca 

- new network.default function which is called by network.rcc and network.spls

- bin.color function added in network.default to color edges w.r.t. the values in the simMat matrix

- nipals has been improved to be computationally more efficient

- missing values are treated as in Tenenhaus in pls, spls and valid functions

- new argument 'ncomp' in rcc function, argument 'ncomp' has been removed from 'summary' and 'rcc'

- new option ("XY-variate") for the argument 'rep.space' in the 'plot3dVar'


Bug fixes:
----------
-'tick marks' values have been corrected for color key in cim

-computation of the simMat matrix for pls and spls - canonical mode, and correction in plotVar, plot3dVar, cim and network

-correction of the default argument 'rep.space = "XY-variate"' in plotIndiv and plot3dIndiv

-correction of the manual



Changes in 2.6-0
================

New features:
-------------
- former R package integrOmics has been renamed mixOmics

- in functions plotIndiv(), plotVar(), cim(), network() the arguments 'dim1', 'dim2', 'ncomp' 
  were replaced by 'comp', a vector of length 2 (by default 'comp = 1:2')

- network() has a new argument 'alpha'
